Catapult
========

Catapult provides Yaml-based object persistence for Vala projects.

_catapult_?
-----------
I hate writing data access layers, mapping data objects to and from Sql, etc, 
which has killed the majority of my data-driven projects over the years. I'd 
never quite seem to get over the database hump and on to the actually 
interesting or fun stuff.

Catapult was written to spare me from those aspects of new projects and help
get the ball rolling on to the interesting bits more quickly 
(thus the silly name). 


Features
--------
* Define entity model with minimal code (extend Catapult.Entity)
* Save and load entities by id or type (Catapult.DataInterface)
* Customize Yaml node building and parsing for objects
  (implement Catapult.YamlObject, or override Catapult.Entity methods)
* Build Yaml document nodes from objects and values (Catapult.Yaml.NodeBuilder)
* Parse objects and values from Yaml document nodes (Catapult.Yaml.NodeParser)
* Read and write Yaml documents directly 
  (Catapult.Yaml.DocumentReader,DocumentWriter)


Requirements
------------
* Vala 0.18.0
* Libgee 0.8.0


Documentation
-------------
Devhelp documentation can be generated by [Valadoc](https://live.gnome.org/Valadoc),
if recent enough to support Vala 0.18.0.

Release tarballs include generated documentation that can be installed and viewed in devhelp.
